## Project Overview
This project is a cloud-based multi-tier web application designed to showcase the implementation of a complete DevOps workflow using Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, GitHub, and AWS. The application supports multiple environment deployments, including development, testing, staging, and production, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: Containerization of applications for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management and orchestration tool to automate application deployment.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage cloud infrastructure.
- **Jenkins**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automation server.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis tool to ensure best practices and maintainability.
- **AWS**: Cloud service provider for hosting the infrastructure.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of the following components:
- **Frontend**: User interface of the web application.
- **Backend**: RESTful API serving application logic.
- **Database**: Persistent data storage for application data.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple backend instances.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerts.
